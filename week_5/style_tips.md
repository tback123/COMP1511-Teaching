# Tom's Top Tips to Code Style
A short explination of common style things that people forget!

## Header comments
- Short description of the program
- zID and dates submitted

## Place holder comments
- Remove any `TODO` comments
- Remove and starter code
- Remove and un-used code

## `#defines`
- Make sure to use them as much as possible!
- No 'magic numbers' in your code
- All constants (numbers or values) that don't change should use a #define
- no `while (counter < 5)` <-- 5 should have a meaning & #define


## Function
- Use them!
- No function should be longer than 100 lines 
- Aim for 50-60 lines
- No such thing as a function too small 
    - Okay to have 1 or 5 line functions!
- No such thing as too many function

## Comments
- Explain what your code does, not how it does it 
- Brief and descriptive
- Typically explain blocks of code
- as if someone has never read the assignment spec
