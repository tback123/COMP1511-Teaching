    Tom's Top Tips to Assignments

    - Header comments
        - short desciption of the program
        - zID & dates submitted

    - Remove place holder comments
        - Starter code or comments 
        - un-used code, remove before submission

    - #defines
        - No 'magic numbers' in your code
        - give all constants meaning
        - no "while (counter < 5)" <-- 5 should have a meaning & #define
    
    - Use of funtions
        - Don't 'over-nest' your control structures
        - No longer than 100 lines
        - Please keep around 50-60
        - Best is ~40

    - Comments
        - explain what your code does, not how it does 
        - brief and descriptive of sections
        - as if someone has never read the assignment spec
